Section 1:
Reviewed relevant research papers to identify key features.
Chose 17 optimal features to construct a classification dataset (1,0) for the project.
Section 2:
Implemented feature preprocessing using 17 Python functions stored in a list to generate the dataset (named url.csv).
Consulted additional research papers to determine suitable models for the project.
Incorporated insights from model selection to refine my approach and enhance accuracy.
Section 3:
Implemented five models, comprising four Machine Learning models and One Deep Neural Network model, based on findings from Section 2.
Identified the best-performing Machine Learning Model and Deep Learning Model
Combined these models to propose an optimized model with a 94.5% accuracy.
Explored another ensemble models
